# Hi :wave: intrigued Human!

This is my Ansible Playground.

- I just started with this chapter, so the work will be very basic
- As a big admirer of SSH, I m very excited to learn more about Ansible

## Projects:

### [Webserver](./ansible-webserver/)
- This sets up a basic webserver with Nginx and a minimalistic HTML page
### [Grafana Remote Install](./grafana/)
- Sets up a server, then installs and configures Grafana on it
### [Prometheus-Service](./prometheus-service/)
- Deploys two instances and installs Prometheus and Grafana for data scraping & visualization
